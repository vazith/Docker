__________DOCKER____________

( EVERYONE SAYS DOCKER IS DEVOPS TOOL ..BUT DEVOLOPERS MUST AWARE ABOUT WHAT IS DOCKERS )

==========================
WHAT IS A DOCKER ...?
========================
DOCKER IS A CONTAINERAZATION TOOL
1. DOCKER, IN ITS SIMPLEST DEFINITION, IS A PLATFORM FOR DEVELOPING, SHIPPING, AND RUNNING APPLICATIONS USING CONTAINERS.
THESE CONTAINERS ARE LIKE STANDARDIZED, PORTABLE PACKAGESTHAT BUNDLE YOUR CODE AND ITS DEPENDENCIES TOGETHER, ALLOWING THEM
TO RUN RELIABLY ON ANY SYSTEM WITH DOCKER INSTALLED, REGARDLESS OF THE UNDERLYING OPERATING SYSTEM OR HARDWARE.
2. OPEN SOURCE
3. BENIFTS :PORTABILITY, SCALABILITY ,CONSISTENCY ,AND RESOUECE EFFICIENCY 

(BEFORE GO TO WHAT IS CONTAINERZATION PART.LETS UNDERSTAND APPLICATION ARCHITECHTURE)

=================================
APPLICATION ARCHITECHURE 
=================================
DEVOLOPERS ----->| FRONT-END ----> | BACK-END | ---> | DATABASE |
FRONT-END IS A USER INTERFARANCE
BACK-END IS A  ONLY  BUSSINESS LOGIC 
DATABASE IS STORAGE WHERE ALL THE DATA STORE
FOR FRONT USES TO DEVLOP (*ANGULAR,*NODEJS* REACTJS..ETC)
FOR BACKEND USE TO DEVLOP (* JAVA ,*.NET * PYTHON *PHP...ETC)
FOR DATABASE USE (*ORACLE,*MYSQL,*SQL*MONGODB,....ETC)

===========================
APPLICATION TECH STACK
=============================
( WHAT IS A APPLICATION STACK ? 
APPLICATION TECH STACK IS A NOTHING BUT A WHICH TYPE AND WHICH VERSION OF TECHONOLOGIES IS USED TO DEVLOP THE APPLICATION)

EX:
FRONT-END : ANGULAR 13 V
BACK-END : JAVA 17V
DATABASE : MYSQL & 8.5V

ONCE THE DEVLOPERS DEVLOP THE APPLICATION.. DEVLOPER STORE THE APPLICATION IN GITHUB
FROM GITHUB .. TESTER DOWNLOAD THE APPLICATION AND TEST THE APPLICATION. AS WELL AS
DEVOPS ENGINNER DEPLOY THE APPLICATION IN HIGH ENIVORMENT 

NOW WE UNDERSTAND THE
=======================================
ENIVORMENT SETUP TO RUN THE APPLICATION (THIS A ENV SETUP WHICH WAS USED BY DEVLOPERS)
========================================
ENVIORMRNT IS A PLATFORM (OR) PLACE WHERE WE CAN RUN THE APPLICATION
--> TAKE ONE MACHINE(PHYSICAL / VIRTUAL )
--> INSTALL ANGULAR 13V 
--> INSTALL JAVA 17V 
--> INSTALL TOMCAT SERVER 9.0V
--> INSTALL MYSQL 8.5V
 
ONCE IS APPLICATION IS DEVLOPED WE ARE NOT GOING TO DELIVERY THAT APPLICATION TO THE CLIENT
WE WILL TEST THAT APPLICATION ON MULTIPLE ENIVORMRNTS 
THEY ARE
========================
APPLICATION ENIVORMENTS 
========================
1. DEV : (DEVLOPERS )DEVLOPERS WILL USE IT FOR INTERGERATION TEST ( FINALY DEVLOPER TEST THE APPLICATION) 
DEVOLPERS TAKE ONE ENIVORMRNTS AND TEST THE APPLICATION ( IN THAT ENIVORMRNT THEY DOWNLOAD ALL THE THINGS LIKE
( ANGULAR , JAVA .MYSQL , TOMCAT ) BY THEY USED VERSION OF THAT APPLICATION )
2. SIT : (SYSTEM INTEGERATION TESTING ) TESETER TEAM WILL USE FOR SYSTEM INTERGERATION TEST
AGAIN TESTING TEAM ALSO TAKE ONE ENVIORMENT AND THEY DOWNLOAD ALL THE  THINGS AGAIN ( ANGULAR , JAVA ,MYSQL ,TOMCAT  ) 
3. UAT : (USER ACCEPTEANCE TESTING ) CLENT TEAM (OR) CLIENT TEST THAT APPLICATION. THAT APPLICATION IS RUNING BY THERE EXCEPTING 
AGAIN CLIENT TEAM ALSO TAKE ONE ENVIORMRNT AND DOWNLOAD NEEDED TECHNOLOGIES
4.PILOT: (PRE-PRODUCTION) APPLICATION WAS TSETED IN PRE-PRODUCTION LEVEL 
HERE ALSO NEED ONE ENVIORMENT TO TEST THE APPLICATION AND DOWNLOAD THAT ALL TECHNOLOGIES
5.PROD:(LIVE ENIVORMENT ) END USER CAN ACCESS THE APPLICATION RUNING IN PRODUCTION 
HERE ALSO NEED ONE ENVIORMENT TO TEST THE APPLICATION AND DOWNLOAD THAT ALL TECHNOLOGIES

ONE DEVLOPERS DEVLOP THE APPLICATON THAT APPLICATION WAS TSESTING ON 5(OR) MORE ENVIORMENTS

---DIAGARAMETIC EXPLANTION----

|----------------------|       |----------------------|     

THE MAIN CHALLANGE IS WE HAVE TO INSTALL REQUIRD SOFTWARE IN EVERY SYSTEM 
EVERY TEAM NEED TO SETUP THE ENIVORMENT AND DOWNLOAD THAT PRE_REQUESTIES  SOFTWARE  RUN THE APPLICATION 

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS SOFTWARE VERSION CONFLICTS 
EX: THE DEV TEAM DEVLOP THE APPLICATION USES  JAVA 17V ..BUT IN CASE OF ANY OTHER TEAM USES JAVA 16 (OR) ANY VERSIONS
THE APPLICATION IS WON'T WORKS (OR) RUN 

( SOFTWARE IS ALSO CALLED AS DEPENDICES )

OTHER CHALLANGES IN DEPLOYMENT PROCESS :
|_____________________________________________________________________________________|
| ---> VERSION CONFLICTS CAN OCCURS                                                   |
| ---> SETING UP ALL REQUIRED DEPENDICES (SOFTWARE) IN ALL MACHINES                   |
| ---> ENVIORMENT SETUP IS TIME TAKEN PROCESS                                         |
| ---> HUMAN ERROR PRONE ( DOWNLOAD THE WRONG VERSION OF SOFTWARE)                    |
| ---> OS VERSION (SOME TIMES )                                                       |
| ---> ENVIORMENT MAINTAINACES                                                        |                                                                                 
|_____________________________________________________________________________________|

SOMETIMES CODE WORKS ON DEVLOPERS SYSTEMS BUT SOMETIMES IT DOESN,T WORKS ON TESTER SYSTEMS 
BECAUSES OF ENVIORMENTS ISSUSES, NOT THE CODE ISSUE 

{ TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM WE USES CONCEPT CALLED DOCKER  }
*IF WE  USE DOCKERS WE NO NEED INSTALL ALL THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT BOTHERING ABOUT REQUIRD SOFTWARE WE CAN RUN THE APPLICATION 
 IN ANY COMPUTER (OR) SYSTEM 
( SOFTWARE IS ALSO CALLED AS DEPENDICES )
* IF WE ARE NOT USING THE DOCKER THAT TIME WE NEED TO SETUP THE ENVIORMRNT AND IT DEPENDICES IN EVERY SYSTEM TO TEST AND RUN
THE APPLICATION

WHAT IS CONTAINERAZATION ..?
================================
CONTAINERIZATION IS A TECHNOLOGY FOR PACKAGING SOFTWARE IN ISOLATED AS SINGLE UNITS CALLED CONTAINERS. THESE 
CONTAINERS INCLUDE EVERYTHING NEEDED TO RUN THE  SOFTWARE - CODE, RUNTIME, SYSTEM TOOLS, SETTINGS - IN A 
STANDARDIZED FORMAT THAT CAN RUN ANYWHERE WITH DOCKER INSTALLED

|_____________|                                              ( UAT , PILOT , PROD  )


WE CAN MAKE PACKAGE APPLICATION CODE AND APPLICATION SOFTWARES (OR) DEPENDICES AS SINGLE UNIT THAT UNIT IS CALLED 
DOCKER IMAGE. ONCE THE DOCKER IMAGE WAS CRATED FOR THE APPLICATION WE CAN RUN THE APPLICATION IN ANY SYSTEM WITHOUT 
BOTHERING ABOUT THE DEPENDICES (OR) SOFTWARE 

IF ANY TEAM NEED TO TEST THE APPLICATION THEY SIMPLE DOWNLOAD THAT DOCKER IMAGES  AND TEST THE APPLICATION TRY
BY USING ONE DOCKER IMAGES WE CAN RUN IN "n" NUMBER OF SYSTEMS WHICH IS CALLED AS DOCKER CONTAINER

DOCKER FILE..?
DOCKERFILE IS A TEXT DOCUMENT THAT CONTAINS INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING A DOCKER IMAGE. 
IT SPECIFIES THE STEPS REQUIRED TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT, INSTALL DEPENDENCIES (OR)
SOFTWARE COPY YOUR APPLICATION CODE, AND CONFIGURE SETTINGS FOR YOUR CONTAINER.

DOCKER IMAGE..?
A DOCKER IMAGE IS A READ-ONLY TEMPLATE USED TO CREATE CONTAINER INSTANCES.
IT'S LIKE A SNAPSHOT OF A CONTAINER'S ENTIRE FILE SYSTEM AND CONFIGURATION AT 
A SPECIFIC POINT IN TIME
( IT IS A PACKAGES WHICH CONTAIN CODE + SOFTWARES (or) DEPENDICES  )

DOCKER REGISTRY..?
DOCKER HUB IS A PUBLIC REGISTRY OF PRE-BUILT DOCKER IMAGES. IT ALLOWS USERS TO SHARE AND DISCOVER IMAGES 
FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS AND TOOLS.

DOCKER CONTAINER...?
WHEN WE RUN DOCKER IMAGE THEN DOCKER CONTAINER WILL BE CREATED . OUR APPLICATION WILL EXCUTE INSIDE THE DOCKER 
CONTAINER
