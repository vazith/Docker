__________DOCKER____________

( EVERYONE SAYS DOCKER IS DEVOPS TOOL ..BUT DEVOLOPERS MUST AWARE ABOUT WHAT IS DOCKERS )

==========================
WHAT IS A DOCKER ...?
========================
DOCKER IS A CONTAINERAZATION TOOL
1. DOCKER, IN ITS SIMPLEST DEFINITION, IS A PLATFORM FOR DEVELOPING, SHIPPING, AND RUNNING APPLICATIONS USING CONTAINERS.
THESE CONTAINERS ARE LIKE STANDARDIZED, PORTABLE PACKAGESTHAT BUNDLE YOUR CODE AND ITS DEPENDENCIES TOGETHER, ALLOWING THEM
TO RUN RELIABLY ON ANY SYSTEM WITH DOCKER INSTALLED, REGARDLESS OF THE UNDERLYING OPERATING SYSTEM OR HARDWARE.
2. OPEN SOURCE
3. BENIFTS :PORTABILITY, SCALABILITY ,CONSISTENCY ,AND RESOUECE EFFICIENCY 

(BEFORE GO TO WHAT IS CONTAINERZATION PART.LETS UNDERSTAND APPLICATION ARCHITECHTURE)

=================================
APPLICATION ARCHITECHURE 
=================================
DEVOLOPERS ----->| FRONT-END ----> | BACK-END | ---> | DATABASE |
FRONT-END IS A USER INTERFARANCE
BACK-END IS A  ONLY  BUSSINESS LOGIC 
DATABASE IS STORAGE WHERE ALL THE DATA STORE
FOR FRONT USES TO DEVLOP (*ANGULAR,*NODEJS* REACTJS..ETC)
FOR BACKEND USE TO DEVLOP (* JAVA ,*.NET * PYTHON *PHP...ETC)
FOR DATABASE USE (*ORACLE,*MYSQL,*SQL*MONGODB,....ETC)

===========================
APPLICATION TECH STACK
=============================
( WHAT IS A APPLICATION STACK ? 
APPLICATION TECH STACK IS A NOTHING BUT A WHICH TYPE AND WHICH VERSION OF TECHONOLOGIES IS USED TO DEVLOP THE APPLICATION)

EX:
FRONT-END : ANGULAR 13 V
BACK-END : JAVA 17V
DATABASE : MYSQL & 8.5V

ONCE THE DEVLOPERS DEVLOP THE APPLICATION.. DEVLOPER STORE THE APPLICATION IN GITHUB
FROM GITHUB .. TESTER DOWNLOAD THE APPLICATION AND TEST THE APPLICATION. AS WELL AS
DEVOPS ENGINNER DEPLOY THE APPLICATION IN HIGH ENIVORMENT 

NOW WE UNDERSTAND THE
=======================================
ENIVORMENT SETUP TO RUN THE APPLICATION (THIS A ENV SETUP WHICH WAS USED BY DEVLOPERS)
========================================
--> TAKE ONE MACHINE(PHYSICAL / VIRTUAL )
--> INSTALL ANGULAR 13V 
--> INSTALL JAVA 17V 
--> TOMCAT SERVER 9.0V
--> INSTALL MYSQL 8.5V
